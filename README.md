## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
 "outputs": [
    {
     "name": "stderr",
     "output_type": "stream",
     "text": [
      "Using TensorFlow backend.\n"
     ]
    }
   ],
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

Hands-On Deep Learning for Images with TensorFlow is for you if you are an application developer, data scientist, or machine learning practitioner looking to integrate machine learning into application software and master deep learning by implementing practical projects in TensorFlow.
