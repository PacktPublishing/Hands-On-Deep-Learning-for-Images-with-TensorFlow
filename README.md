## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
 "outputs": [
    {
     "name": "stderr",
     "output_type": "stream",
     "text": [
      "Using TensorFlow backend.\n"
     ]
    }
   ],
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
